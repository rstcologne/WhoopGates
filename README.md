# Intro
This FreeCad Model to create fully parametric parts to build gates for inddor whoop flying.

Currently it's heavily work in progress. 

## Parametric

The design is created as parametric as possible so it can be adjusted to different led strips, gate sizes, number of gate corners, arbitrarily angled corners etc.. The parameters can be set in a spreadsheet within the model.
